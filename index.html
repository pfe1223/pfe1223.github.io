      This image is based on the <a href="https://10print.org/">10 Print</a> program, which is a simple generative art program originally written in Basic. I used Dan Shiffman's Coding Train <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEyTZ5ZZxZs">video</a> to walk me through the basics.

      This came from a freshman Math project to help visualize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo</a> method, which derives (more or less) Pi from the ratio of randomly distributed points inside the circle to the total number of points.

      Normally this image would be a P5 animation. 2017 was the 75th anniversary of the release of Albert Camus' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stranger_(novel)">The Stranger</a>. Some of the freshmen decided to code an animation that represented one of Camus' major themes. In the animation, the mouse controls the position of the gray circle. As it moves toward the group of circles in the middle, a barrier appears. The gray circle cannot pass through the barrier. This represents the theme of exile.
